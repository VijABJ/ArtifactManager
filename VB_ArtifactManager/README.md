[h1]Artifact Manager[/h1]

This is a combination of some artifact-related mods I've been playing with.
The mod list is getting a little too long, so I decided to combine some of
them in one mod.

So far, here are the mods I've combined:

[oList]
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2748508571]Clear Artifact Levels[/url]
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2776119489]Court Artifacts in Inventory[/url]
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2752573001]Distribute Artifacts (note: only on default list view)[/url]
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2747305366]Auction Off Artifact[/url] 
[/oList]

[h1]To The Original Authors[/h1]
All of the content are their authors' property, and I was just trying to
reduce the clutter in my mod list, and my UI.  Ping me if this isn't 
something you'd like available, and I'll take it down.

ADDED FEATURES:
[oList]
[*] Added game rules for stuff.
[*] Integrated edit artifact description mod.
[*] Mass distribute artifacts with minimal clicks.
[*] Repair ALL with one click.
[*] Sell ALL unused with one click.
[*] Combine and Upgrade artifacts game rules.  Combine is now an ongoing task.
[*] Upgrading artifacts in-place.
[/oList]

Upgrade mechanics is straightforward, and simplistic.  You can control this with the Upgrade game rule, which you can disable.
All it does is max out all the existing modifiers, and make the artifact illustrious.  You cannot upgrade relics, or anything
else with already maxed out modifiers.  The upgrade cost depends on what rarity is the starting point, which are the following:
[oList]
[*] Illustrious = 1000g
[*] Famed = 2200g
[*] Masterwork = 3300g
[*] Common = 5000g
[/oList]

I'll be working to add mechanics to combine artifacts, and I'm open to suggestions.

TODO:
[list]
[*] Add combining artifacts replacement.
[*] More balancing of upgrading options/costs.
[/list]

FILTERS for bulk operations are available.  You can filter whom to give it to, and what quality to give.
(IGNORE the Dynasty option -- didn't work and was replaced with Close Family option instead)
