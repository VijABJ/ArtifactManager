[h1]Artifact Manager[/h1]

This is a combination of some artifact-related mods I've been playing with.
The mod list is getting a little too long, so I decided to combine some of
them in one mod.

So far, here are the mods I've combined:

[oList]
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2748508571]Clear Artifact Levels[/url]
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2776119489]Court Artifacts in Inventory[/url]
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2774914093]More Artifact Slots + Combine Artifacts + Upgrade Artifacts[/url]
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2799478496]Repair All[/url]
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2752573001]Distribute Artifacts (note: only on default list view)[/url]
[/oList]

Extra: Works with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2747305366]Auction Off Artifact[/url] -- just load this one after that.  All credits for this behavior goes to  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/grimvek]grimvek[/url], author of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2776119489]Court Artifacts in Inventory[/url]. 


[h1]To The Original Authors[/h1]
All of the content are their authors' property, and I was just trying to
reduce the clutter in my mod list, and my UI.  Ping me if this isn't 
something you'd like available, and I'll take it down.
