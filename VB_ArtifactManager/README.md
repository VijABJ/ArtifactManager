[h1]Artifact Manager[/h1]

This is a combination of some artifact-related mods I've been playing with.
The mod list is getting a little too long, so I decided to combine some of
them in one mod.

So far, here are the mods I've combined:

[oList]

[/oList]

[h1]To The Original Authors[/h1]
All of the content are their authors' property, and I was just trying to
reduce the clutter in my mod list, and my UI.  Ping me if this isn't 
something you'd like available, and I'll take it down.

ADDED FEATURES:
[oList]
[*] Mass distribute artifacts with minimal clicks.
[*] Repair ALL with one click.
[*] Sell ALL unused with one click.
[*] Combine and Upgrade artifacts integration can be toggled in game rules.
[/oList]

FILTERS for bulk operations are available.  You can filter whom to give it to, and what quality to give.
(IGNORE the Dynasty option -- didn't work and was replaced with Close Family option instead)
