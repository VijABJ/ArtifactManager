[h1]Artifact Manager[/h1]

This is a combination of some artifact-related mods I've been playing with.
The mod list is getting a little too long, so I decided to combine some of
them in one mod.

So far, here are the mods I've combined:

All of the content are their authors' property, and I was just trying to
reduce the clutter in my mod list, and my UI.  Ping me if this isn't 
something you'd like available, and I'll take it down.
